Once this script is installed, attempting to edit a tarfile will present the
user with a list of files contained in the tar archive.  By moving the cursor
over a filename and pressing ENTER, the contents of a file can be viewed in
read-only mode, in a new window.  Unfortunately, write support for tarfile
components is not currently possible.

Requires GNU tar, or a tar implementation that supports the "P" (don't strip
out leading /'s from filenames), and "O" (extract files to standard output)
options.  Additionally, gzip is required for handling *.tar.Z, *.tar.gz,
and *.tgz compressed tarfiles, and bzip2 is required for handling *.tar.bz2
compressed tarfiles.  A unix-like operating system is probably also required.
